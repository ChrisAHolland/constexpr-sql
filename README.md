# constexpr-sql
A light weight single header alternative to DBMS

This library was developed during my honors project at UVic under the supervision of [Bill Bird](https://github.com/billbird).
The original development occurred in my [metaprogramming-optimization repo](https://github.com/mkitzan/metaprogramming-optimization), but was splintered into a new repo to focus the content.
